# Gaussian Elimination

## Overview
This Java project implements the Gaussian Elimination method to solve systems of linear equations. It includes functionalities for converting a system of linear equations into row echelon form and back substitution to find the unique solution set if one exists.

## Features
- **Matrix Operations**: Includes basic matrix operations necessary for Gaussian elimination such as row swapping, multiplying and adding rows, and more.
- **Row Echelon Form**: Converts any matrix to its row echelon form.
- **Back Substitution**: Performs back substitution on an upper triangular matrix to find the solution set.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or above
- JUnit 5 for running tests
